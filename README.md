# Weather App

## Documentation

### Getting Started

#### Opening

Once you open the application, it detects your current location using your position's latitude and longitude giving you the current weather information and a 3-hour weather forecast in a line chart for the next 48 hours.

#### Find out about other cities and countries

You can use the search bar above to search for any country or city you like.

How to:

- Write the city's name
- in case if it didn't work out like you wanted, make sure to add the country's abbreviation to be more accurate. (ex. Cairo, EG)

#### Need to go back to your current location?

Just click on "Current Location" button next to the search bar and BOOM, you are back to the homeland.
